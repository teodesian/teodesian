* Tested higher-order java applications running emulators of said calculators (and one Computer Algebra System on a stick called the n-spire)

## Testimonials

### [Rikus Goodell](https://github.com/cpanelrikus) - Senior Developer at cPanel

During his years at cPanel, George built up many of the tools that continue to power the QA department to this day, especially in automation of the Perl-based QA test suite and the VMs on which it runs. I would describe him as a pioneer of the group who helped make it possible for dozens of others to do their jobs efficiently. After he moved to a product developer role, I got the chance to work with him on a daily basis as part of a Scrum team, and I enjoyed having him as a teammate. One pattern he consistently shows is a relentless drive to solve problems, by whichever means fits the best in the situation. As a primary author of much of our test automation code, he is also no stranger to tackling large challenges single-handedly, and I find this independent mindset to be one of his most admirable qualities. Whether something needs to be fixed or something needs to be built from the ground up, George will make it happen.

### [David Lanning](https://github.com/davehhpnet-zz) - Senior QA at cPanel

After working with George closely for years - not only did he help me grow Professionally - He also set an example I took home with me having the effect of making me a better person myself. Technically there was never a scenario I witnessed George not handle effectively, precisely, and thoroughly. Any endeavor he chooses to undertake would serve everyone well to pay attention.

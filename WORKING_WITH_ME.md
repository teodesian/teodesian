# Working with Troglodyne LLC

I work as a freelance/consulting software engineer and tester.  A "hired gun" for your development team.
My twin brother also works with me, so if you need to "double up" the work and clone me, that's easily do-able.

If you instead want an overview of my work history, please see my profile page here:

## Communications protocols

For urgent communications texting is preferred.
Everything else should be email, save for collaboration sessions over Zoom/Skype etc.

We write a LOT and are well versed in using Bug Trackers, Wikis, planning software, Source Control and Testing Management Systems.

My goals for written communications are as follows
* Keep everyone up to date with the how, what & why of the work
* Leave a record of this for future developers so they don't have to figure out our reasoning the "hard way" later
* Make sure that others can pick up the ball where we left it when needed.

We generally do not participate in "chat rooms" such as slack.
If you insist we use them, expect responses only to direct messages, as we do not have time to read every thought falling out of every head.

## Feature Development

When developing new features the primary concern is to minimize time wasted when we discover our acceptance criteria we went into the project with changed upon exposure to reality.
Quick turnaround via a focus on prototyping and getting things into customer hands is paramount.
To ensure this, we have to focus up-front on having reproducible, testable environments for our product; preferrably automatically provisioned.
We then need to have code review take precedence over all other activity, so we can get new revisions into the hands of testers as quickly as possible.
When done testing we can then use the same provisioning mechanisms to demo to customers.

## Bug Fixing

Most of bug fixing comes down to reproducibility and reliability of the reporter.
Sometimers this means you have to mind-read, play inquisitor or chase ghosts until you see something you can grab by the tail.
Even with very little clues there is very little that an `strace` or code analysis can't figure out.

That said, there are usually multiple options to fix things (none of them perfect, or the bug wouldn't be here).
That means yet more horse-trading until a clear sign appears (or not), followed by a deployment to staging and then onto production.

## Testing

Having done testing so long, We are only interested in taking test lead roles.

We generally start out building a strategy to test the area (Component, Integration or Acceptance) which has had the least scrutiny thus far, up to those with the most (filling gaps on the way up).
We then pare that down to what we can get done in the time allotted and see if management is OK with the implied risks of the strategy.
From there we either do the work, or negotiate schedule.

When dealing with new or theoretical systems, we are quite experienced with building fakes and mocks along with flat-out gedankenexperiments and challenging developer assumptions up-front.
Much of the work is simply asking questions, especially during early code reviews.
Having mutual scrutiny as early as possible is key to the quality process functioning.

## Productivity and Pedagogy

Analyzing and Implementing strategies to improve both tester and developer productivity is one of our talents; we primarily achieve this through automation.
We are quite capable of raising junior engineers up to senior through targeted instruction, and have done so multiple times in our carreers.

## Systems deployment and administration

We have deployed a number of web hosting, database, NAS, media servers and other computers over the years, and even done frontline technical support.
From managing fleets of workstations to servers, we've done it all.
This is mostly a details and requirements job.
Once you know what you want, we provision it and things work.  Simple as.
If you don't know what you want, but have an idea, we're happy to help you figure it out.

## Typical engagement Structure and Rates

We generally prefer to work about 10-20 hours per week at a rate of $100/hour.  If you are interested in a regular deal, rather than sporadic assistance we invoice monthly.
